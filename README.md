Introduction
------
Many methods have been developed to detect transposable element (TE) insertions from whole genome shotgun next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, each of which has different dependencies, run interfaces, and output formats. Here, we have developed a meta-pipeline to download, install and run six available methods for detecting TE insertions in NGS data, which generates output in the UCSC Browser extensible data (BED) format.

The complete pipeline requires a fasta reference genome, a fasta consensus set of TE sequences present in the organism and fastq paired end sequencing reads. Optionally if detailed annotation of the reference TE sequences has been performed, a GFF file with the locations of known TEs present in the reference genome and a tab delimited hierarchy file linking these individual insertions to the consensus they belong to (an example of this file is included in the test directory as sac_cer_te_families.tsv) can be supplied. If only single ended sequencing data are available then this can be supplied as option -1 however only ngs_te_mapper and RelocaTE will run as these are the only methods that handle it.

Software Dependencies
------
All of the software systems must be run on a unix based system with the software dependencies listed per method below. FastQC is an optional step, if the software is not present then mcclintock will skip the step and you will not receive a quality report for your fastq input in the results directory. The versions used to run this pipeline are indicated in parentheses and no guarantee is made that it will function using alternate versions. In the case of bwa it is almost certain that some methods will fail if version v.0.7.4-r385 is not installed.

How to run 
------

###Installation
To install the software, from the main pipeline directory, first clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:bergmanlab/mcclintock.git
```

Then cd into the project directory and run the script install.sh with no arguments:

```
cd mcclintock
sh install.sh
```

This will download and unpack all of the TE detection pipelines and check that the required dependencies are available in your path. Missing dependencies will be reported and you must install or make sure these are available to run the full pipeline.

###Running on a test dataset
A script is included to run the full pipeline on a test Illumina resequencing dataset from the yeast genome. To run this test script change directory into the directory named test and run the script runttest.sh. 

```
cd test
sh runtest.sh
```

This script will download the UCSC sacCer2 yeast reference genome, an annotation of TEs in the yeast reference genome from [Carr, Bensasson and Bergman (2012)](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0050978), and a pair of fastq files from SRA, then run the full pipeline.

###Running the pipeline
The pipeline is invoked by running the mcclintock.sh script in the main project directory. This script takes the following 6 input files, specified as options:
* -m : A string containing the list of software you want the pipeline to use for analysis e.g. \"-m relocate TEMP ngs_te_mapper\" will launch only those three methods [Optional: default is to run all methods]
* -r : A reference genome sequence in fasta format. [Required]
* -c : The consensus sequences of the TEs for the species in fasta format. [Required]
* -g : The locations of known TEs in the reference genome in GFF 3 format. This must include a unique ID attribute for every entry. [Optional]
* -t : A tab delimited file with one entry per ID in the GFF file and two columns: the first containing the ID and the second containing the TE family it belongs to. The family should correspond to the names of the sequences in the consensus fasta file. [Optional - required if GFF (option -g) is supplied]
* -1 : The absolute path of the first fastq file from a paired end read, this should be named ending _1.fastq. [Required]
* -2 : The absolute path of the second fastq file from a paired end read, this should be named ending _2.fastq. [Optional]
* -o : An output directory for the run. If not supplied then the reference genome name will be used. [Optional]
* -b : Retain the sorted and indexed BAM file of the paired end data aligned to the reference genome.
* -i : If this option is specified then all sample specific intermediate files will be removed, leaving only the overall results. The default is to leave sample specific intermediate files (may require large amounts of disk space)
* -C : This option will include the consensus TE sequences as extra chromosomes in the reference file (useful if the organism is known to have TEs that are not present in the reference strain). [Optional: default will not include this]
* -R : This option will include the reference TE sequences as extra chromosomes in the reference file [Optional: default will not include this]
* -p : The number of processors to use for parallel stages of the pipeline. [Optional: default = 1]
* -h : Prints this help guide.

Example pipeline run:
```
sh mcclintock.sh -m "RelocaTE TEMP ngs_te_mapper" -r reference.fasta -c te_consensus.fasta -g te_locations.gff -t te_families.tsv -1 sample_1.fastq -2 sample_2.fastq -p 2 -i -b
```

Data created during processing will be stored in a directory in the output directory (if one is specified) within main directory named after the reference genome used with individual sub-directories for samples. 

###Output
Output files for a full McClintock run or individual components are located in a directory named with the following path structure /reference_genome/sample_name/results/. All directories referred to below are contained within this parent directory.

If FastQC was present on the system, then output of FastQC will be stored in the directory /qualitycontrol/fastqc_analysis. The qualitycontrol directory also includes a file with the output of bamstats and a file with the estimated median insert size of the library for paired-end samples.

Original results files produced by each method are stored in the directory /originalmethodresults, containing one sub-directory for each method. Orignal files are then merged and filtered to create 0-based .bed6 format files. For TEMP, Retroseq, and PopoolationTE, original files are converted into *raw.bed which contains all, unfiltered predictions. Score (Retroseq, ≥6) or read support (TEMP and PopoolationTE, reads found for both ends) are used to filter raw prediction to create *redundant.bed files. For RelocaTE, original files from individual families are merged and used to create *redundant.bed directly.  For TE-locate, original files are used to create *redundant.bed directly. *redundant.bed are filtered to remove predictions that have the identical coordinates for different TE families, with the prediction having the greatest read support (RelocaTE, TEMP, PopoolationTE, TE-locate) or score (Retroseq) being retained. Non-identical overlapping predictions are retained. The final output file of the run scripts for individual methods is *nonredundant.bed. For ngs_te_mapper, no filtering or merging is needed, and thus *nonredundant.bed files are created directly.

Individual methods output predictions in different annotation frameworks, which are standardized in *nonredundant.bed as follows: 
 * For ngs_te_mapper, non-reference TEs are annotated as 0-based TSDs and reference TEs are annotated as empirical 0-based intervals, and thus no coordinate conversions are needed to create *nonredundant.bed files. 
 * For RelocaTE, non-reference TEs are annotated as 1-based TSDs and reference TEs are annotated as the same 1-based intervals provided in the reference annotation. Start coordinates are transformed by -1 to create *nonredundant.bed files. 
 * For TEMP, non-reference TEs with or without split-read support are annotated as 0-based intervals in the Start and End columns on the basis of closest supporting read-pairs. Non-reference TEs with split-read support at both ends are annotated as ?-based TSDs in the Junction1 and Junction2 columns. Only predictions with read support on both ends ("1p1") were retained. For predictions with split-read support on both ends, TSDs were used in the *nonredundant.bed. For all other predictions, read-pair intervals were used in *nonredundant.bed.
 
The 4th column of *nonredundant.bed files contains a string with the name of the TE family, whether it is a non-reference or reference insertion, the sample name, the method name, the evidence type (sr = split-read, rp = read pair), and a numerical index of the prediction in the *raw.bed or *redundant.bed file. The final *nonredundant.bed output file also includes a header line for use with the UCSC genome browser.
